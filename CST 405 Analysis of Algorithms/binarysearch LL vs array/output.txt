Test Results for 1000 random numbers input:
It took 1122750 data transfers to complete the binary-search tree.
It took 3e-005 seconds to build the a full tree.
It took 0 seconds to traverse the tree.
It took 0 seconds to lookup 1000.
When two items had the same value while doing the insertion, it caused a
data colision, and the copy causing the collision was thrown out.
After roughly half the items are deleted, it takes 0 seconds to traverse the tree.
For the timer's precion, there is definitely a difference in traversal time.

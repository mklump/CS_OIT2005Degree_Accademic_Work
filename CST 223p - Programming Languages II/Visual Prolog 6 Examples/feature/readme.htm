<h1>Feature demo</h1>
<p>This example shows a number of new features in VIP6, which is new compared to
VIP5.</p>
<p>The program is not &quot;sensible&quot;, it merely contains a lot of code
that illustrates new features.&nbsp; So you should examine the code carefully.</p>
<h2>Build and Run</h2>
<p>Load the project <a href="Feature.prj6"><i>Feature.prj6</i></a> into the VDE and press F9 (Execute), or build the project, and then run <i>
<a href="Exe/Feature.exe"> exe/feature.exe</a></i>
.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to run it from a command prompt (otherwise the window
closes very rapidly).</p>

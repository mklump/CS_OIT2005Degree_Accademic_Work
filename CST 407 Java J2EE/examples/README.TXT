******************
Command-line users
******************

The chapters folder contains all the example code for the book arranged by chapter
and figure number. If you are using the command-line tools to compile and execute
the examples in the book, use the code in this folder. Copy the appropriate folder 
from the CD to your hard drive. Then, when you compile each example, be sure to 
create the appropriate directory structure for the compiled .class files. The 
easiest way to do this is to use the following command line:

   javac -d . *.java

This command line will compile all the Java source files in the current directory
and place the resulting .class files in the appropriate directory structure.



*****************************
Development Environment Users
*****************************

The packages folder contains all the example code for the book arranged by package
in the appropriate directory structure. Most Java development environments enable
you to "mount" or "import" such a directory structure into the development
environment to edit and compile the source files. For example, if you are using
NetBeans or Forte for Java, copy the packages folder to a folder on your hard drive 
and from the File menu, choose "Mount Filesystem." From the resulting dialog box,
choose the packages folder. You will now see the entire folder hierarchy for the 
examples in the book in the Explorer.

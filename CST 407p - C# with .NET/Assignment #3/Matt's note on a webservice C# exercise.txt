I have heard so much about how web services can revolution the very same business functions we still do repetitively today. So naturally I thought all of the code samples availabe on the particular page were of great interest:

It goes on to talk about how a beginner like me could write my very onw C# application, and test it with the instructions given.
Perhaps maybe we could try it as an exercise?

This will test the default constructor.
R = 255, G = 255, B = 255
R = 255, G = 255, B = 255
This will test the three arguement constructor for black.
R = 0, G = 0, B = 0
R = 0, G = 0, B = 0
This will test the three arguement constructor for various colors.
R = 0, G = 255, B = 255
R = 45, G = 57, B = 26
This will test the overloaded addition operator.
R = 68, G = 155, B = 255
This will test the overloaded less than operator.
R = 45, G = 57, B = 26
This will test the overloaded subtraction operator for dark colors.
R = 0, G = 43, B = 44
This will test the overloaded subtraction operator for light colors.
R = 56, G = 20, B = 0
This will test the overloaded less than operator again.
R = 24, G = 242, B = 255

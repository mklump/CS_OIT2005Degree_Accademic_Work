my funny valentine
on a clear day
some enchanted evening
what kind of fool am i
who can i turn to
paint your wagon
with a little bit of luck
look to the rainbow
from this moment on
get me to the church on time
if i were a rich man
the lady is a tramp
let me entertain you
the night they invented champagne
